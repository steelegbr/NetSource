# NetSource

NetSource is a cross-platform application for generating live network radio programmes. The initial plan is a system that can generate confirmation tone / messages with audible timestamps to give an indication of how delayed the feed is. Live programming will be faded in for a scheduled time and faded back out again afterwards. This audio stream will be sent to Icecast/Shoutcast for distribution. There is currently no plans for handling split programming through the transmission of metadata.
